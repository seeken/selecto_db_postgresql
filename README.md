# SelectoDBPostgreSQL

PostgreSQL adapter package for the Selecto ecosystem.

This package provides `SelectoDBPostgreSQL.Adapter`, an external adapter module
for using Selecto against PostgreSQL via `postgrex`.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:selecto, ">= 0.4.11 and < 0.6.0"},
    {:selecto_db_postgresql, ">= 0.4.9 and < 0.6.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

Pass the adapter explicitly when configuring Selecto:

```elixir
selecto =
  Selecto.configure(domain, pg_opts,
    adapter: SelectoDBPostgreSQL.Adapter
  )
```

## Notes

- Placeholder style is `$N`.
- Identifier quoting uses double quotes.
- Pool-backed execution delegates to `Selecto.ConnectionPool`.

## Atomic write graphs and MERGE

The adapter executes `Selecto.Write.Graph` inside one native transaction. It
resolves generated parent keys, enforces every row cardinality, and rolls back
the complete graph on any ownership or statement failure.

Owned-set sync automatically selects the strongest safe strategy supported by
the connected server:

| Server | Strategy |
| --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL 17+ | One relation-level `MERGE` with `RETURNING`, `merge_action()`, and `WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE` delete-missing |
| PostgreSQL 15–16 | Ordered parameterized updates/inserts plus identity-safe delete-missing in the same transaction |
| Older/unknown | The same ordered atomic fallback; no MERGE claim is advertised |

Pure nested inserts continue to use `INSERT … RETURNING`; they are not forced
through `MERGE`. Updato does not expose a strategy switch. Capability reporting
includes `merge`, `merge_returning`, and `merge_delete_missing` so diagnostics
can explain the selected path.

## Local Workspace Development

For local multi-repo workspace development, set:

```bash
SELECTO_ECOSYSTEM_USE_LOCAL=true
```

When enabled, this package resolves a local path for `selecto`.
